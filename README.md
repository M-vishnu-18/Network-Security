üåê Web-Based Security Tools
This repository features a collection of interactive, client-side web applications that demonstrate fundamental cybersecurity concepts and offer lightweight utility for security analysis. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, these tools run directly in your browser, requiring no backend server.

üöÄ Projects Included
1. üîê Web File Integrity Checker (file_integrity_checker.html)
A user-friendly tool to verify the integrity of local files, ensuring they haven't been tampered with or corrupted.

Functionality:
Allows you to select any file from your local machine.
Calculates the SHA-256 hash of the selected file directly in your browser using the Web Cryptography API.
Displays the computed hash.
Enables comparison of the calculated hash against a manually entered "stored hash," providing an immediate check for file modifications.
Use Case: Perfect for swiftly validating the integrity of downloaded software, critical documents, or any file where changes need to be detected. It beautifully illustrates the power of cryptographic hashing in maintaining data trustworthiness.
Security Principle Demonstrated: Data Integrity through Hashing.
2. üõ°Ô∏è Network Security Audit Dashboard (network_audit_dashboard.html)
An interactive dashboard that simulates a basic network security configuration audit. This tool helps you understand the security implications of various network setups based on provided data.

Functionality:
Provides input fields to enter:
A comma-separated list of open ports.
A comma-separated list of running services.
A line-by-line summary of firewall rules.
Performs client-side analysis of your input against common security best practices and known insecure configurations (e.g., widely open ports, insecure services like Telnet, overly permissive firewall rules).
Generates a risk assessment and offers practical security recommendations based on the identified potential issues.
Use Case: An excellent educational resource for grasping the impact of network configurations. It's valuable for quick self-assessments or training exercises to identify common weaknesses in network security posture.
Security Principles Demonstrated: Network Security Best Practices, Principle of Least Privilege, and simulated Vulnerability Identification.
üßë‚Äçüíª How to Use
Getting these tools up and running is straightforward:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/web-security-tools.git
(Remember to replace YourUsername with your actual GitHub username!)

Navigate into the project directory:

Bash

cd web-security-tools
Open the HTML files in your favorite web browser:

For the Web File Integrity Checker: Double-click file_integrity_checker.html or drag it into your browser.
For the Network Security Audit Dashboard: Double-click network_audit_dashboard.html or drag it into your browser.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the core content and user interface.
CSS3: For styling the applications, providing a clean and intuitive user experience.
JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Powers all the interactive logic, including hash calculations, data analysis, and dynamic content updates.
Web Cryptography API: Leveraged by the File Integrity Checker for secure and efficient SHA-256 hashing directly within the browser environment.
